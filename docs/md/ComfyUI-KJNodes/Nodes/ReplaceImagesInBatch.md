# Replace Images In Batch
## Documentation
- Class name: `ReplaceImagesInBatch`
- Category: `KJNodes/image`
- Output node: `False`

This node is designed to replace a subset of images within a batch with a new set of images, starting from a specified index. It facilitates the manipulation of image batches by allowing selective updating of images, which can be useful in various image processing and augmentation tasks.
## Input types
### Required
- **`original_images`**
    - The batch of original images that will be partially replaced. It plays a crucial role in the operation by serving as the base for the replacement process.
    - Comfy dtype: `IMAGE`
    - Python dtype: `torch.Tensor`
- **`replacement_images`**
    - The images that will replace a portion of the original image batch. Their inclusion directly alters the content of the batch starting from the specified index.
    - Comfy dtype: `IMAGE`
    - Python dtype: `torch.Tensor`
- **`start_index`**
    - The index within the original image batch from which the replacement should begin. It determines the starting point for the replacement operation.
    - Comfy dtype: `INT`
    - Python dtype: `int`
## Output types
- **`image`**
    - Comfy dtype: `IMAGE`
    - The modified image batch after the replacement operation has been performed.
    - Python dtype: `torch.Tensor`
## Usage tips
- Infra type: `GPU`
- Common nodes: unknown
