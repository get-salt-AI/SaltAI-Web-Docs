# Compare
## Documentation
- Class name: `Compare-🔬`
- Category: `Logic`
- Output node: `False`

The Compare node is designed to evaluate the relationship between two inputs based on a specified comparison operation (e.g., equality, inequality, greater than, less than). It abstracts the logic of comparison into a simple interface, allowing users to dynamically assess the conditions between inputs and derive a boolean result indicative of the comparison's outcome.
## Input types
### Required
- **`a`**
    - The first input to be compared. It plays a crucial role in determining the outcome of the comparison operation.
    - Comfy dtype: `*`
    - Python dtype: `UNKNOWN`
- **`b`**
    - The second input to be compared against the first. Its value is essential in evaluating the comparison operation.
    - Comfy dtype: `*`
    - Python dtype: `UNKNOWN`
- **`comparison`**
    - Specifies the type of comparison to perform between the two inputs (e.g., '==', '!=', '<', '>', '<=', '>='). This parameter dictates the logic applied in the comparison.
    - Comfy dtype: `COMBO[STRING]`
    - Python dtype: `str`
## Output types
- **`B`**
    - Comfy dtype: `BOOLEAN`
    - unknown
    - Python dtype: `unknown`
## Usage tips
- Infra type: `CPU`
- Common nodes: unknown
