# RegionalSampler
## Documentation
- Class name: `RegionalSampler`
- Category: `ImpactPack/Regional`
- Output node: `False`

The RegionalSampler node is designed to selectively apply different sampling strategies across various regions of an input, enhancing the denoising process by adjusting the sampling technique based on regional characteristics. This approach aims to improve the overall harmony and quality of the generated output by compensating for areas that may not be adequately denoised using standard methods.

    - To smooth the seams of the region boundaries, expand the mask set in regional_prompts by the overlap_factor amount to overlap with other regions.
    - Comfy dtype: `INT`
    - Python dtype: `int`
- **`restore_latent`**
    - At each step, restore the noise outside the mask area to its original state, as per the principle of inpainting. This option is provided for backward compatibility, and it is recommended to always set it to true.
    - Comfy dtype: `BOOLEAN`
    - Python dtype: `bool`
- **`additional_mode`**
    - Specifies the mode of operation for additional denoising in regions not properly denoised by the primary sampler. It determines whether to disable the feature, increase the total denoise amount, or divide the denoise amount between the primary and recovery samplers.
    - Comfy dtype: `COMBO[STRING]`
    - Python dtype: `str`
- **`additional_sampler`**
    - Defines the recovery sampler to be used for additional denoising. It can be set automatically based on the primary sampler or manually chosen to best suit the specific needs of the region.
    - Comfy dtype: `COMBO[STRING]`
    - Python dtype: `str`
- **`additional_sigma_ratio`**
    - Controls the multiplier for the noise schedule applied in the additional denoising step, according to the selected additional_mode.
    - Comfy dtype: `FLOAT`
    - Python dtype: `float`
## Output types

    - Comfy dtype: `LATENT`
    - The output latent image after processing through the regional sampling strategies.
