# ComfyUI_FaceAnalysis
ComfyUI_FaceAnalysis is an extension that leverages DLib or InsightFace to calculate the Euclidean and Cosine distances between two faces, aiming to evaluate the similarity of generated faces against a set of reference images. It suggests sending a batch of three reference images to establish a baseline for comparison with generated images, enhancing the accuracy of face analysis.
