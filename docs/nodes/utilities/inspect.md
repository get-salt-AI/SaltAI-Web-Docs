# Inspect

Node for inspecting and logging data flowing through the workflow. Displays a visual preview and logs information about the input value.

## Quick Start

1. Add the Inspect node to your workflow.
2. Connect any node output to the Inspect node's input.
3. Run the workflow to view inspection results and image preview.

## Setup Guide

### 1. Add Node to Workflow
1. Locate the Inspect node.
2. Drag it into your workflow editor.

### 2. Connect and Configure
1. Connect the output you want to inspect to the Inspect node's input.
2. Optionally, toggle logging with the write_logs input.

## Basic Usage

### Inspecting Data
* Use to debug or visualize any data flowing through your workflow.
* Supports tensors, images, JSON, and strings.
* Preview images are auto-extracted if possible.

## Configuration

### Required Inputs
| Field      | Description                | Type     | Example   |
|------------|----------------------------|----------|-----------|
| value      | The value to inspect       | Any      | 42, "text", tensor |
| write_logs | Enable/disable logging     | Boolean  | True      |

### Optional Inputs
*None*

### Outputs
| Field         | Description                        | Example   |
|--------------|------------------------------------|-----------|
| value        | Inspected value (as string/JSON)   | "42", "{...}" |
| image_preview| Preview image tensor               | tensor    |

## Best Practices

### Debugging
* Use Inspect nodes at key workflow points to monitor data.
* Enable write_logs for detailed logging during development.

### Visualization
* Use the image preview to quickly verify image data.
* Chain multiple Inspect nodes for stepwise inspection.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
* **No image preview:** Input data may not be an image or valid base64 string.
* **Unreadable output:** Non-JSON or complex objects may be stringified.

### Need Help?
* Check workflow logs for error messages.
* Review input data types for compatibility.
