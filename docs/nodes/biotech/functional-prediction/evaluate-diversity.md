# Evaluate Diversity

Runs diversity evaluation pipeline on the provided batch of proteins. Clusters structures based on TM-score and outputs a CSV table with cluster indices for each input.

## Quick Start

1. Connect a batch of PDB structures to the node.
2. Set the maximum TM-score threshold for clustering (e.g., 0.6).
3. Specify the number of processes for parallel evaluation (default: 8).
4. Run the node to obtain a CSV with cluster assignments.

## Setup Guide

### 1. Prepare Input Structures
1. Generate or collect a batch of PDB structures to evaluate.
2. Ensure each structure has a unique identifier.

### 2. Configure Diversity Evaluation
1. Set `max_ctm_threshold` to control cluster separation (lower = stricter clustering).
2. Adjust `num_processes` for available compute resources.

## Basic Usage

### Batch Diversity Assessment
* Cluster a set of generated or designed proteins to assess structural diversity.
* Identify representative structures from each cluster for downstream analysis.

## Configuration

### Required Inputs
| Field              | Description                                              | Type   | Example |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|
| pdb                | Structures to evaluate.                                 | PDB    | {"design_1": "...", "design_2": "..."} |
| max_ctm_threshold  | Maximum TM score threshold between clusters.            | FLOAT  | 0.6     |
| num_processes      | Number of processes for parallel evaluation.            | INT    | 8       |

### Optional Inputs
*None*

### Outputs
| Field     | Description                          | Example |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|---------|
| score.csv | Scores of the pdbs (cluster indices).| CSV file with cluster assignments |

## Best Practices

### Diversity Parameter Tuning
* Use a lower `max_ctm_threshold` for stricter clustering (more clusters, higher diversity sensitivity).
* Increase `num_processes` to speed up evaluation on large batches if hardware allows.

### Workflow Integration
* Use after protein generation to select diverse candidates for further analysis.
* Combine with functional evaluation nodes for comprehensive assessment.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
* **All structures assigned to one cluster**: Try lowering `max_ctm_threshold` to increase sensitivity.
* **Node runs slowly on large batches**: Increase `num_processes` if possible, or reduce batch size.
