## Quick Start

1. Prepare MSA search results in A3M format using the Colabfold Search node.
2. Connect the A3M output to the Colabfold Batch node.
3. Run the node to generate ranked PDB foldings.

## Setup Guide

### 1. Prepare Input Data
1. Use the Colabfold Search node to obtain MSA results in A3M format.
2. Ensure each sequence is properly formatted and identified.

### 2. Run Colabfold Batch
1. Connect the A3M input to the Colabfold Batch node.
2. Execute the node to receive ranked PDB foldings for each input sequence.

## Basic Usage

### Batch Structure Prediction
* Input a batch of A3M-formatted MSA results.
* Obtain 5 ranked PDB foldings per input sample.
* Use outputs for downstream analysis or visualization.

## Configuration

### Required Inputs
| Field | Description | Type | Example |
|-------|-------------|------|---------|
| a3m | MSA search results in a3m format. | A3M | {"seq1": "...", "seq2": "..."} |

### Optional Inputs
*None*

### Outputs
| Field | Description | Type | Example |
|-------|-------------|------|---------|
| folding.pdb | Ranked foldings as a dict {pdb_id_rank_id: pdb_content}. | PDB | {"seq1_ranked_1": "...", "seq1_ranked_2": "..."} |

## Best Practices

### Input Preparation
* Ensure A3M input is generated by the Colabfold Search node for compatibility.
* Use clear, unique sequence IDs to avoid confusion in output mapping.

### Output Handling
* Use the ranked outputs for further evaluation or visualization.
* Integrate with downstream nodes for workflow automation.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
* **No output generated**: Verify that the A3M input is correctly formatted and not empty.
* **Unexpected output IDs**: Ensure input sequence IDs are unique and consistent.
